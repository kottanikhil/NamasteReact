What is Emmet ? 
Emmet is a built-in feature in Visual studio code which helps the user to write the HTML and CSS in an easier way and saving you a lot of time instead of manually typing the whole component.
Emmet uses different abbreviations and short expressions depending on whatâ€™s passed, and then dynamically converts the abbreviations into the full code. Emmet is mostly used for HTML, XML, and CSS, but it can also be used with programming languages.
